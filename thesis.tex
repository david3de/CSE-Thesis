% ABSTRACT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{abstract}
In an increasingly technological world, society has found an astonishing number of ways to integrate the Internet into day-to-day devices. For example, Google and Amazon have extensive development in smart home devices and toy companies have been developing smart toys for children. However, as a newly blooming technology, the security aspects of IoT are still mostly unexplored.

With the recent increase in popularity of the Internet of Things, many companies quickly developed new devices using this technology. While taking advantage of this technology has yielded many benefits and conveniences in the past few years, the glaring issue of security has not been properly addressed. We have seen many recent attacks on children through IoT devices, mainly baby monitors and nest cameras. Additionally, while security mechanisms do exist and are available for use, general users without a technical background may not see the risks as something worth putting effort into mitigating. In this thesis, we address this issue and provide a solution to persuade more users to be wary of the risks at hand when ignoring proper attention to the protection of their data and privacy.

\chapter{Introduction}

Every dissertation should have an introduction.  You might not realize
it, but the introduction should introduce the concepts, backgrouand,
and goals of the dissertation.
