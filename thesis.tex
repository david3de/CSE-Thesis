% ABSTRACT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{abstract}
With the recent increase in popularity of the Internet of Things, many companies quickly developed new devices using this technology to stake a claim in a blooming industry. While taking advantage of this technology has yielded many benefits and conveniences in the past few years, the glaring issue of security has not been properly addressed. We have seen many recent attacks on children through IoT devices, and while security mechanisms do exist and are available for use, general users without a technical background may not see the risks as something worth putting effort into mitigating. 

In this thesis, we perform a network analysis on some of the existing products available on the market and collect survey data from parents and their understanding of IoT technologies. We then address the issues in IoT security and provide a solution to persuade more users to be wary of the risks at hand when ignoring proper attention to the protection of their data and privacy.

% INTRODUCTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Introduction}
In recent years, society has found an astonishing number of ways to integrate the Internet into day-to-day devices. From smartphones to wearable technology, all devices that are connected to the Internet are encapsulated under the Internet of Things (IoT) \cite{gubbi:iot}. In recent history, modern companies have been finding different ways to incorporate this realm into households; for example, Google and Amazon have extensive development in smart home devices and toy companies have been developing smart toys for children. Overall, the expansion of IoT has enabled massive growth in recent years. Reports have shown that the number of existing Internet-connected devices is projected to grow to 14.7 billion in 2023, 48\% of which accounts for connected home applications, such as smart home devices and security cameras. \cite{cisco}.

However, as a newly blooming technology, the security aspects of these devices are still mostly unexplored. Reports of data leakage and account breaches \cite{wp:camera} for smart devices are rather common as a result of the lack of concern for security on Internet-connected devices; evidently, the importance of implementing security mechanisms into smart devices increases as adversarial parties find new ways to target and attack IoT devices.

Furthermore, with recent expansion of devices for children, parents may be putting their children's at risk. Developers, on the other hand, must also be aware of the additional security measures necessary to satisfy laws such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) \cite{reyes:coppa}. As a younger generation becomes more accustommed to an increasingly technological world, we must recognize the risks that children are exposed to when using an IoT device. 

While other works have delved into topics involving smart devices in both security and marketing, we are concerned with a parent's mental model of how IoT and cloud services work and what they are concerned about when their children are exposed to these technologies. We then want to analyze on-the-market products with their cloud architectures and develop a threat model of possible attack vectors. We aim to compare the two models and recommend implementable changes and improvements upon existing features.

In the remainder of this thesis, Chapter \ref{ch:background} begins with exploring the backgrounds of IoT technologies and an analysis of end-user security. Chapter \ref{ch:methodology} explains the methodology of our research process and provides details on our data collection and network analysis. Chapter \ref{ch:mental} and \ref{ch:taxonomy} go into detail on our survey data and technical data, respectively. Finally, chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} concludes our research by recommending security mechanisms to better protect a user's data based on our findings through survey data and network analysis.

% BACKGROUND %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}
We begin our investigation by reviewing existing issues found in IoT devices and children's interactions on the Internet.

\section{End-User Perceptions}
While most Internet users understand its inherent risks, it can often be difficult for less experienced users to follow recommended security practices in order to keep their data safe; even the most sophisticated security mechanisms are useless if a user refuses to employ them. Oftentimes, reinforcement learning helps individuals develop habits and pattern recognition, but a lack of concrete results deters these practices. For example, positive outcomes in good cybersecurity awareness include \textit{not} having one's data breached and \textit{not} being the target of an attack. Negative outcomes in bad cybersecurity practices include exposure of data and loss of resources, which may not even occur at all. Research has shown that due to a lack of tangible results in both positive and negative reinforcement in cybersecurity practices, it can often be hard to motivate their integration \cite{west:psychology}.

We aim to model, in general, a parent's perception of modern IoT devices. Previous research conducted by Zeng et al. \cite{zeng:enduser} has shown that smart home users with a technical background tended to better understand cloud infrastructure and how data is collected from a device and transported over a network. Additionally, these users have also shown more concern about the privacy of the data collected by these smart home devices. Inversely, users with less experience with technology tend to show less concern for their data and show little to no understanding of their device's network infrastructure. 

However, a separate study by McReynolds et al. \cite{mcreynolds:toysthatlisten} shows that parents convey more concern for data privacy when their children are involved. When asked questions regarding smart toy and smart device privacy, many parents showed concern for data collection and parental controls, while some of the older children inteviewed expressed concern for a lack of privacy from their own parents.

This investigation may show that parental care plays a role in cybersecurity awareness, which affects a parent's likelihood to purchase and use IoT devices. For our research, our goal is to build a generalizable mental model that encapsulates parents' privacy concerns for their children, understanding of cloud networks, and willingness to allow their children to use a smart device. 

\section{IoT Security Standards}
Smart devices and IoT may open up attack vectors for hackers and other adversaries to take advantage of. Consumers often trust developers and companies to implement sound security mechanisms, or simply are not aware of the importance of their implementation. Unfortunately, there have been many reports of attacks on insufficiently secure devices and applications. For example, an article had found that smart cameras and baby monitors have been at risk due to a lack of security in the mobile applications required to use them. Without mechanisms such as Multi-factored Authentication (MFA), hackers have been able to access the cameras using username-password combinations that were stolen and sold on the Internet \cite{wp:camera}. This process is coined \textit{credential stuffing}.

Dophin attacks, another vector made possible by voice-controlled assistants (VCA), involve ultrasonic sounds inaudible to the human ear that can activate the VCAs built into many IoT devices today \cite{dolphin}. Through dolphin attacks, hackers can sometimes access private data and trigger features unintended by the owner of the device. Attacks like these can often be difficult to predict and prevent due to their invisibility.

Other studies have found hardware issues in devices that could compromise user privacy and data. A study by Streiff et al. \cite{streiff:overpowered} shows that a smart toy by Fischer conceals an Android tablet motherboard. Researchers found that root access to the board was unprotected and that it was easy to gain access to both the camera and microphone built into the toy; it is entirely possible for an attacker to take advantage of this poor design to spy on other consumers.

Evidently, the industry has yet to fully understand each vulnerability that resulted through the widespread usage of IoT technologies. Our research aims to analyze two IoT products and develop a threat model for both, looking for vulnerabilities in their mobile applications, networks, and hardware.


\section{Children's Protection}
Under United States law, children's personal identifiable information is heavily protected under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). When providing a service or product that is connected to the Internet to children under the age 13, developers are legally required to obtain parental permission and inform users of data collection. Data collection must be kept to a bare minimum for a product to function and collected data must be available for review and deletion.

Ever since COPPA was passed, many tools and resources were created to help developers implement extra measures for protecting children's data. For example, some software development kits (SDK) provide extra options to limit the kinds of data an application is able to collect \cite{reyes:coppa}, and Samet Privacy's kidSAFE\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Seal Program (fig. \ref{fig:kidsafe}) verifies the COPPA-compliance of devices and applications.

While meeting COPPA standards is a legal requirement for any Internet-connected product available in the United States, research has shown that developers often neglect doing so. Reyes et al. \cite{reyes:coppa} have found that out of the top 5,885 children's mobile applications on the Google Play Store analyzed in their study, a majority of them are potentially violating COPPA standards due to misuses of mobile SDKs. This discovery shows that although there are laws in place to ensures the safety of children's data, this industry has yet to fully accomodate for the requirements set through these laws. 

Another study conducted by Le et al. \cite{le:skillbot} delves into the safety of Amazon's VCA Alexa, which found that many children's built-in applications, called \textit{skills}, harbored inappropriate contents and often collected too much data for COPPA-compliance. The study also found that many parents had concerns regarding the content of these skills and often did not take full advantage of parental control features.

    \caption{The kidSAFE seal of certification helps parents identify Internet-connected products that are verifiably COPPA-compliant.}
\end{figure}

With the data and privacy of children at risk, it has become ever so important for developers to be wary of what data their products collect and what content is available to children. Finally, our study aims to find better methods of data collection and suggest implementing several mechanisms that can help ensure children's safety. 

% METHODOLOGY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Methodology}
\label{ch:methodology}
Our research delves into two separate fields. We explore both end-user psychology through survey data as well as the technical aspects of existing IoT products that are currently available on the market.

\section{End-User Mental Model}
To build a generalizable mental model on parents and IoT devices, we ran a survey (Appendix \ref{app:questions}) to better gauge the experiences and opinions of parents concerning smart devices designed for children. We ask questions regarding their experience with technology, thoughts on smart devices and smart toys, privacy practices, and demographics. Additionally, we show the subjects short videos demonstrating two smart devices designed for children and ask about their thoughts and concerns about them.

Our survey was conducted on parents of children aged 6 or younger. Our research is app

\section{Device Taxonomy}
In the technical aspects of our research, we look into two smart devices designed for children that are available on the market. 

\subsection{Network Analysis}
In order to develop threat models for our devices, we investigate the security standards of these devices.

\chapter{Device Taxonomy}
\label{ch:taxonomy}
We perform network analyses on two separate products: Amazon's Echo Dot for Kids and the Roybi Robot, both of which are smart devices designed for children's use. In our analyses, we pay attention to each feature the devices offer and how they communicate with their cloud services and the parent's mobile device through its designated application.
